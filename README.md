## What's up! 🤗

I'm Stella, and I'm currently pursuing a Bachelor's in Computer Science and Math.

I design and build whatever I can think of purely for the love of the game! Once a seed is planted in my brain, 
I can't help but try to program it.

On my page, you'll find repositories that sort my projects by their "difficulty" ⛏️ (if you play MC). Some projects
are still in the works.

Of course, my journey is still far from over, so there will definitely be more to come!

Thanks for stopping by! 🚀



**PS:**
- I love playing volleyball, so if you're looking for someone to play...REACH OUT ASAP
